## booting into windows issue
* originally I had a dual boot setup with windows 10 and manjaro
* a manjaro update messed up the grub menu, could no longer boot from windows
* here's how I fixed it:

Enter Grub commandline
> insmod part_msdos
> 
> set root=(hd0,msdos1)
> 
> chainloader +1
> 
> boot

* warnings: make sure to do "ls" first to make sure you set the right root partition
* also, make sure you choose the right filetype. in my case it was "msdos", but it could be gpt/efi/nfts/etc.

## STRANGE TRACKPAD ISSUE FIX!!!!!
* mkdir /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d
* cp ~/thinkpadfixes/50-touchpad.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-touchpad.conf
* then restart the X session by 

> sudo pkill x

or reboot
