# T500

## Black screen boot
* remove the CMOS battery, laptop tries to boot 2 times and fails, before successfully booting into bios
* whatever changes made in BIOS only save if you are still connected to power... once you unplug the laptop everything resets (this is why the CMOS battery exists)
* forum posts say that the graphics are the problem, because the T500 has switchable graphics that can cause problems on Windows 10... if I disable this, the laptop does not reboot into bios or anything, I have to unplug it.
* I swapped the boot order around so it would boot directly into the HDD, which already had Manjaro on it... that worked
* I tried to sign into manjaro but it stalled, I think I put panorama DE on there and it just bugged out, idc. 
* rebooted into a bootable usb, and reinstalled Manjaro, it worked.
