### Issues
* fan pin is slightly bent; fan makes noise, but I doubt there is a loss in effectiveness.
* screen has a couple of minor scratches. planning on replacing with AFFS screen anyways.
* replaced fan assembly with aftermarket fan from ebay. chinese fan and housing is a bit thicker.
* sometimes it throws a fan error, fixed by shaking the laptop a bit and booting again.
* I assume this is due to a crappy chinese fan housing, but I can't put the new fan in the old housing because the fan is too thick.
