# T410
* purchased at recycler for $20
* specs: https://imgur.com/a/rPyKf4u

## Issues
* water damaged, screen is waterlogged but still works (looks like sheets of ice)
* trackpad doesn't work, neither do trackpad buttons (trackpoint is still good)
* smells like mineral deposits/chlorine (probably from a flood)
* still booted up immediately after purchase, battery even holds a little charge
