# T410
### first one
* purchased at recycler for $20
* specs: https://imgur.com/a/rPyKf4u

### second one
* purchased from shopgoodwill
* specs: i5-520M / 800p panel / working battery. couldn't be bothered to boot it up for a screenshot

## Issues (first one)
* water damaged, screen is waterlogged but still works (looks like sheets of ice)
* trackpad doesn't work, neither do trackpad buttons (trackpoint is still good)
* smells like mineral deposits/chlorine (probably from a flood)
* still booted up immediately after purchase, battery even holds a little charge
